# Word-Guess-Game

## What is this?
This is a version of hangman centering around the sci-fi shows that I enjoy. It's mobile responsive and should work on all screens sizes.

## Why is this useful?
This is useful for me to track my progress in my coding boot camp and remember some of the stuff I've done in the past. It may also be helpful to other new coders to see possible ways to do things.

## How to get started?
Follow the instructions on the screen when you load the game. You'll start by clicking the button and then, depending on your screen size, will either use your keyboard or the on screen buttons to play the game.

## Where to get help?
You can reach out to me diretly, but I make no claims as to how quickly I'll get back to you. The best bet is to just Google what you're stuck on. That's what I did to create this game. W3Schools, Mozilla's Develper Network, and Stack Overflow were really helpful resources.

## Maintence and contributions
This game may be periodically maintained by me and as of this writing, I'm the only contributor to it.
